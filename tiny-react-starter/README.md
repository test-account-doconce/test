# Tiny React Starter (Vite)

A minimal React + Vite starter you can run locally in seconds.

## Run locally

```bash
# 1) Unzip the folder
# 2) Open a terminal in the project directory
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

## Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## What's inside

- React 18 + Vite
- One component (`src/App.jsx`) with a tiny counter and a mock "fetch" demo
- Minimal styling in `src/styles.css`

Feel free to add a router, state manager, or your favorite UI kit.
